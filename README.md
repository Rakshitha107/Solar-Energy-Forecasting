# Solar-Energy-Forecasting
Conducted in-depth analysis of power generation and sensor data from two solar power plants in India. Utilized machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms to forecast energy output. Highlighted the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Plant 1 and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for Plant 2 in predicting power generation
